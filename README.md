# How To Play:

### Rules
Select three cards to form a set by clicking on them.

If the selected cards form a valid set, they are removed from the board and you earn a point.

If the selected cards do not form a valid set, you lose a point.

Continue selecting sets until no valid sets remain on the board, or until time runs out.

### A Valid Set
Each card has four attributes: color, shape, shade, and number.
In order to form a valid set you need three cards in which each of the attributes is either all the same or all different across the three cards, and this is for every attribute.

### Examples of set
#### Matching set


Card 1: Red, 2 squiggles, solid

Card 2: Blue, 1 squiggle, solid

Card 3: Green, 3 squiggles, solid

Explanation: All attributes are either all the same or all different across the three cards.
#### Non-Matching set

If card three were red, the color attribute would no longer be unique or all the same even though the other atttributes are fine.

# Modes
